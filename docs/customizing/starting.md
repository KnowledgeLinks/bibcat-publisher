#Start Development
In order to get things up and running so you can see the effects, you'll need to open up two command lines. One for NPM, and one for flask.


##Flask

In one, navigate the Publisher directory and use Python for the command 

```javascript
Python run.py
``` 

You may need to activate your local python environment.

##NPM

In the other, navigate to catalog\static and run

```javascript
npm run watch
``` 

You'll need to rerun this every time you make a change.
